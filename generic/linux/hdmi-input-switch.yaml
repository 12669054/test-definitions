    steps:
        - Connect the output HDMI cable to Monitor/TV.
        - Make sure Monitor/TV has display input from at least one other source too.
        - Boot the board to UI.
        - Switch input display from Monitor/TV to board and other input source.
        - Repeat the process few times.

    expected:
        - "Switching HDMI resolutions from UI should work well."
        - "No Kernel panic, crash, hang or any other severe error observed while switching input."
