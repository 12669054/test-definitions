    steps:
        - Connect the serial cable.
        - Install minicom on host PC.
        - "$ sudo apt-get install minicom"
        - Launch minicom run "$ sudo minicom -s"
        - Set data transfer speed to "115200 8N1". For ARM Versatile Express board, it is "38400 8N1"
        - Save and exit minicom.
        - Re-launch minicom and run "$sudo minicom"
        - Power on and boot the board under test.
        - For Hikey board, If the 4 pin jumper block for UART0 is installed, attach a serial terminal and
          ensure the console is displayed on the serial terminal. If a mezzanine board is available for UART1,
          install it, attach a serial terminal and ensure the console is displayed on the serial terminal.


    expected:
        - "Verify that the output looks good."
        - "Verify that you can type in serial console."
